What would be a good name for software which ring fences a company's access to AI capabilities in house without ever sending data off site? 

I think there is an upcoming market for ringfenced LLM for companies concerned with using ChatGPT ad leaking their IP

My question is if we create a ring fenced LLM, how do we get that model in the first instance. Is it already trained?

Explain what machine learning weights are in simple terms.

Please give me a list open open, free models we could use
